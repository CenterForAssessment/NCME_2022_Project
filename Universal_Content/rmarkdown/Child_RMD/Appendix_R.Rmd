# R Session Information

Since R and R packages are constantly evolving you might want to add the R session
info that contains information on the R version as well as the packages that are
loaded [@Bauer2018-dl].  

```{r r-session-info, echo=FALSE}
# set width option to force fit onto page margins
options(width=75)
print(sessionInfo(), locale = FALSE)
# when using child='Appendix_*.Rmd'
# knitr::knit_print(capture.output(print(sessionInfo(), locale = FALSE)))
```

<!-- ## All the code in the paper

*** NOTE: This doesn't work when your using `child = ` in the "parent" .Rmd file!!! ***

To simply attach all the code you used in the PDF file in the appendix see the R
chunk in the underlying `.rmd` file:

```{r, allrcode, ref.label=knitr::all_labels(echo == TRUE), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, results='asis'}
```
