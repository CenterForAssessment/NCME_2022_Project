# Introduction

At the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern and the
United States Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health
emergency for the United States. Although many continued to carry out their daily
lives without interruption, drastic changes began to occur in `r params$state.name`
and around the country.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have far-reaching effects on all facets of our
lives. The impact on education included school closures in Spring 2020 and a 2020-2021
academic school year with mixed remote and in-person instruction that looked and
felt quite different from pre-pandemic times. `r params$state.name`, like all states,
is currently grappling with evaluating the academic impact the pandemic has had,
as well as how to make efficient, targeted use of resources to resources to
ameliorate learning loss.
