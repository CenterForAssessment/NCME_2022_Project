The COVID-19 pandemic is having far-reaching effects on all facets of our lives.
The impact on education included school closures in Spring 2020 and a 2020-2021
academic school year with mixed remote and in-person instruction that looked and
felt quite different from pre-pandemic times. PRM__state.name__PRM, like all states,
is currently grappling with evaluating the academic impact the pandemic has had,
as well as how to make efficient, targeted use of resources to resources to
ameliorate learning loss.

This report investigates the pandemics impact on student achievement (status) and
growth. To pursue this investigation, historical TXT__test.name.abv__TXT data was
used to establish "fair" achievement comparisons and to derive baseline student
growth percentiles (i.e., describing 2021 growth relative to 2019 norms). Data
in TXT__test.subj__TXT was used in these investigations.
