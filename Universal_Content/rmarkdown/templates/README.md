templates
=========

This directory contains templates for generating `pagedown` reports. This directory
has been structured similarly to what is found/required in many `R` packages.
Although the assets contained in these templates could be linked to directly a
copy may be needed in the working directory used for report generation. This is
true for particular rendering methods (`bookdown`), and makes it easier for most
(e.g. `pagedown`) others.

That said, a common copy is kept here in the "Universal_Content" directory so that
changes made for one "state" or branch of the project can be made available for
others (usually requiring a project asset "update" function or procedure).
